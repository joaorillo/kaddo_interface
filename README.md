# 🌐 Overview

**Kaddô** is a startup founded by João Pedro N. Rillo in 2023, born out of a deep frustration with the user experience in supermarket e-commerce platforms. Since then, we've been building technology solutions to not only address these shortcomings but to transform grocery shopping into a true **experience**.

This project is a new version of our interface, integrating several innovative solutions developed over the past few years. Some tools are proprietary and hosted privately on our servers. You may notice parts of the project interacting with our official API (endpoints starting with `https://kaddo.com.br`).

## 🔍 Key Innovations

- **Category-based Interface**  
  Designed to improve user experience in supermarket e-commerce, making it easier to browse and compare products. *(Patent pending)*

- **Custom Search Engine Optimizer**  
  Built specifically for supermarket needs, delivering highly relevant results—solving a pain point still common in Brazilian e-commerce platforms (as of 2025).  
  📄 [More info](./presentations/kaddo_search_engine.pdf)  

  🔎 Try the following queries on our interface and compare the results to any Brazilian supermarket's search engine:  
  - `Leite`  
  - `Papel higiênico`  
  - `Café`  
  - `Nescau`  
  - `Achocolatado líquido`  
  - `Saco de lixo azul`  
  - `Desodorante feminino`  
  - `Chocolate barra`

- **Public API**  
  Access all our core solutions—completely free—including our smart search, personalized to each store’s inventory.
